# Synteny reconstruction 

Files labelled as `{sp1}_{sp2}_synt.txt` contain sorted and indexed coordinates of orthologuous genes in pairs of species. 
These files can be used to plot oxford dotplots using the code contained in `plot_synt_clg.R`. 
Further information about chromosomal assigment to ALGs can be found in `spur_alg_assign.txt` (S. purpuratus) and `pliv_alg_assign.txt` (P. lividus). 
Plots of syntenic arrays across chromosomes are computed using Rideogram as described in `ideogram.r`.
