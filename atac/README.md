# ATAC-seq

The classification of ATAC-seq data across stages is performed in `classif-atac.ipynb` using the files in this repository. 

The primary narrow peaks files generated by `generich` are the following: 

```
16-cells_all.npk.gz
EarlyBlastula_all.npk.gz
LateBlastula_all.npk.gz
Gastrula_all.npk.gz
Pluteus_all.npk.gz
Prism_all.npk.gz
```

`Pybedtools` is used to perform intersection with repeats from `Pliv_PqN3S.rep.bed.gz`,  Phastcons conserved regions from `echino2.mostcons.bed.gz` and assignment of closest genes as well as relative location of peaks toward the TSS from  `Pliv_aH2p.filt.bed.gz`. 

Results of [TOBIAS](https://github.com/loosolab/TOBIAS) analysis of TF occupancy is also provided as `pk_bd_tf_an.tsv.gz` for binding in individual peaks and `bindetect_results_anf.txt.gz` for assessment of differential binding across stages. 

Global peak characterisation is included in `stage_peaks_anc_sel.txt.gz`.
